# Dom's Guide to San Francisco! 

## Sometimes you dont know what to eat, sometimes you want to eat EVERYTHING and sometimes you will just eat anything. This is a guide of some of my personal favorites in the city. 
### While you may know heard of some of these places, there are a some that you may not have heard of. Don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. I encourage you to have your palet explore. 
### DISCLAIMER: These are some of MY favorites. 

## Brunch
### Heads up. We love brunch here. Be prepared to wait in line for some of these.

* [Kitchen Story](http://kitchenstorysf.com/kitchen_Story_California_Cuisine/Kitchen_Story_California_Cuisine___Breakfast_Lunch_Dinner___Mother_Kitchen.html) - Mission / Castro District
* [Blackwood](http://www.blackwoodsf.com/) - Marina District
* [Sweet Maple](http://sweetmaplesf.com/Sweet_Maple/Sweet_Maple___Breakfast___Brunch___Lunch______2101_Sutter_St._San_Francisco,_CA_94115.html) - Fillmore District
  * All three of these restaurants are fantastic. The menus are fairly similar so I believe they are owned by the same. 
  * *Must Trys* French Toast, Soju Bloody Mary, Millionaires Bacon

* [St. Francis Fountain](http://www.stfrancisfountainsf.com/) - Mission District
  * Nice 50's esque diner with an amazing brunch menu. They also have one of the best vegan breakfast/brunch selection
  * *Must Trys* Nebulous Potato Thing, Chef's Mess, Huevos Rancheros, Veggie Mess

* [Very Vegan Sundays](http://www.somastreatfoodpark.com/events-db/2015/5/27/2rp1l0p3g375wesrrhw3vj3e25zzze) - SOMA District
  * One Sunday a month, the street food park goes completely vegan. It is ridiculously good for vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters alike!
  * *Must Trys* Everything. But be sure to stop by [Hella Vegan Eats](http://www.hellaveganeats.com/).

* [OOLA](http://www.oola-sf.com/) -- SOMA District
  * Fancier breakfast place with less of a possibility of waiting in line. 
  * *Must Trys* Hazelnut Chocolate Stuffed French Toast, Fines Herbes & Goat Cheese Ommelette

* [Brenda's French Soul Food](http://frenchsoulfood.com/) - Tenderloin District
  * Cajun Soul Food themed restaurant. While the outside streets arent appealing, this place is definitely worth the wait. 
  * *Must Trys* Beignets! 

* [Serpentine](http://www.serpentinesf.com/) - Dogpatch District
  * Similar to OOLA, a little fancier but well worth it. It has a concrete loft feel to it. 
  * *Must Trys* Fried Egg Sandwich, Huevos Rancheros, Orange Juice (seriously, they have amazing orange juice)

* [Boogaloo](http://www.boogaloossf.com/) - Mission District
  * It's a themed restaurant but I dont really know what the theme is? 50's-60's music scene? Also have great vegan / vegetarian options for brunch. 
  * *Must Trys* Desayuna Tipico, Temple O' Spuds

* [Eats](http://www.yelp.com/biz/eats-san-francisco) - Inner Richmond District
  * Traditional American Brunch place
  * *Must Trys* Vegetarian Omelette, Chicken and Waffles 

* [Red Door Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-door-cafe-san-francisco-3) - Lower Pacific Heights 
  * This place may not be for everybody. While it's a favorite of mine, it is more of an "anti-establishment" vibe. There is a clear sign that tables are only for up to 4 people and no outside food or drink allowed (especially your starbucks cup). There are also adult items on the tables and decor. May not be a place for the kiddos. It's entertaining though. 
  * *Must Trys* Spicy Vegan BBQ Chicken, Grandpa Need Spanking

* [Mission Beach Cafe](missionbeachcafesf.com) - Mission District
  * Prepare to wait in line for a while, but it's definitely worth it. 
  * *Must Trys* Brioche French Toast, Braised Lamb Bistro, Dungeness Crab and Bay Shrimp Benedict

* [Beachside](http://www.beachsidesf.com/) - Outer Sunset
  * THis place is adorable and away from the downtown hustle. Everything is locally sourced and hand-crafted.
  * *Must Trys* Breakfast Burrito, BBQ Pulled Pork, Fried Chicken Sandwich
