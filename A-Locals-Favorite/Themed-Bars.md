# Dom's Guide to San Francisco! 

## Themed Bars 

Personally, I am not much for the themed bars but these are some in the city that I know of. Many came from [UpOut's List](http://www.upout.com/blog/san-francisco-3/8-of-the-coolest-theme-bars-in-san-francisco)

* [Wilson & Wilson](http://thewilsonbar.com/) - Tenderloin District
..* Theme: Private Detective Agency
..* Overall: Quiet, intimate 

* [Novela](http://novelasf.com/) - SOMA District
..* Theme: Library 
..* Overall: Nice, cocktail bar. Drinks are named after authors and famous characters

* [Butter](http://www.smoothasbutter.com/) - SOMA District
  * Theme: Trailer (Editors Note: I dont particularly care for a bar that marginalizes and makes light of poverty)
  * Overall: Loud and club like atmosphere. Serves popcorn, tator tots and grape soda. 

* [Noir](http://www.upout.com/blog/san-francisco-3/noir-sf.com) - Hayes Valley
  * Theme: Film Noir 
  * Overall: Gets crowded. It's a combination of people trying to have a dinner and people coming for just drinks. Getting a seat can be a challenge depending on where you go. Beers only served in bottles but they have some non-traditional ones. There is also live piano and sax playing from time to time. 

* [Kozy Kar](http://www.mazeltovproductions.com/) - Nob Hill 
  * Theme: Late 70's and Early 80's Pornos
  * Overall: The barstools and booths are car seats and there is a lot of vintage decor. While it's a nice bar with more of a divey feel to it, there is also a feel of... don't touch that...... 

* [Bourbon & Branch](http://www.bourbonandbranch.com/) - Tenderloin District
  * Theme: 1920's Speakeasy
  * Overall: There are two ways you can go here. One way requires a reservation and some strict speakeasy-eqsue rules, such as a password to enter (password given with reservation). The second is the side entrance, the Library. It gets SUPER crowde on weekend nights. 

* [Local Edition](http://localeditionsf.com/) - SOMA District
  * Theme: Vintage Journalism 
  * Overall: It's pretty dark in here and everything is a crafty cocktail. 

* [Smuggler's Cove](http://smugglerscovesf.com/trapdoor/) - Fillmore District
  * Theme: Pirates. It's a Pirate themed bar. 
  * Overall: Depending on the night it can be a bit much. Weekends are crowded with out of towners. Best night to go is probably Tuesday evenings. They have fantastic rum collection and even have bowls to share. 

* [Topsy's](http://www.topsyssf.com/) - Financial District
  * Theme: Circus 
  * Overall: Smaller bar but it's fun. Great cocktails, not too sweet not too bitter. Fun Decor. 

* [Brewcade](http://www.brewcadesf.com/) - Castro District
  * Theme: Arcade
  * Overall: It's a beer place, I dont think they have liquor, but with over 20 beers on tap, I dont think you'll mind. There is a full arcade and old school movies from the 70's-90's. All of the arcade machines even have cup holders for your beers. Can get a bit crowded but you dont end up waiting too long for a turn on the game you want to play.
