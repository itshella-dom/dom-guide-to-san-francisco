# Let's go out and do something
### There is a ton of things to do in SF, but if you don't know where to look, you might just get caught in tourist traps. Remember what I mentioned with the cable car tip? There's more. Check out below. You can google any of these if I didn't include a link.

### I didn't include things like "bike the Golden Gate Bridge" "walk along Pier 39 and have a sourdough clam chowder bowl" because I am not going to just echo what everyone else will tell you. You're likely already planning to do those things. 

## Walk

* Check out Billy Goat Hill 
	* Up in Glen Park... Bernal Heights ish? Park and take a very short walk over. It's a look out point overlooking the southern half of the city. 
	* There's a rope swing... Use at your own risk. This isn't a managed site.

* "Hike" up Corona Rock (Red Rock)
	* Calling it a hike is a joke, it's like walking up steep...ish stairs. You can likely do it in 10 minutes. It can get a bit windy but it gets you a gorgeous view of the city. Take your pup up there if you brought them. They love the hike and dogs are welcome.

* Land's End & Old Sutro Baths
	* All the way on the other end of the city is Land's End. It's separated from the city...ish, maybe only a couple of buses will make it out there but there is parking if you have a car. 
	* It can get muddy
	* At the end of the hike (hiking trails are clearly marked), there is a cliff. PLEASE BE CAREFUL. There are no guardrails. It's an unobstructed view of Golden Gate Bridge. You breath in the ocean and you are away from the noises of the city. It's calming and somber in a way. 
	* Suto Baths is on the opposite side of the hike. It's again a hike down so if you need assistance or you have difficulty with stairs, it is not recommended. There is a fascinating history behind Sutro baths. You can read about it [here](http://www.sutrobaths.com/). Do NOT prepare to go swimming here. (tl;dr in the late 1800s early 1900s this was a bathhouse and public pool that burned down in the 1960s. It's now a historical landmark). It's cold, dangerous and just don't. 

## See

* [The Tiled Steps Project](http://www.tiledsteps.org/)
	* Located between 15th and 16th on Moraga in Inner Sunset 
	* Just a beautiful sight

* Check out the [Secret SF Rooftop Parks](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/san-francisco/financial-district/secret-sf-rooftop-parks-fidi-soma-popos-thrillist-san-francisco)
	* My favorite is on Sansome. Grab a sandwich and have lunch up there.	

* Check out [Clarion Alley](http://www.yelp.com/biz/clarion-alley-san-francisco) and [Balmy Alley](http://www.balmyalley.com/Welcome.html)
	* Check out some beautiful city art. This street is full of murals and street art	

* Take a tour of [The Armory Studios](http://www.armorystudios.com/) - Mission
	* It's a porn studio owned by Kink.com You can take a tour of it. 	

## Do	

* Ride a cardboard down the [Seward Street Slides](http://www.yelp.com/biz/seward-street-slides-san-francisco). 
	* Cardboard usually sits at the top. Sure, you can do this in Golden Gate Park, but that's more for children and people look at your weird if you are there without a child. 
	* Use at your own risk. This is not a managed site.

* Grab a sandwich at [Ike's Place](http://ilikeikesplace.com/san-francisco) and walk over to Dolores Park. It's currently being renovated but it's a great park. There are so many quadrants! 
	* Check out the [Local's Drawing of Dolores Park Map](https://cdn.society6.com/cdn/0025/p/10040300_7900345_lz.jpg). 
	* I'd pick Dolores Park over Golden Gate any day
	* The top corner has a great view of the city on a clear night
	* Don't be surprised to see naked people, parrots flying around, drum circles and people openly smoking/selling weed.

* Check out tee [Parrots of Telegraph Hill](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-parrots-of-telegraph-hill-san-francisco)
	* For some reason Parrots like this tree during their migration. Personally I hate birds but it's a bunch of colorful loud ass birds in a tree. People like it for whatever reason. 

* Take a class at [San Francisco Circus School](http://circuscenter.org/)
	* Learn how to trapeeze, work the rope, juggle, parkour
	* Classes for kids 
	* Professional and so much fun 

* The Lab Cafe [Tasting Projects](http://thelabcafesf.com/tasteProject/)
	* Taste stuff from cheeses to beers to salts etc.

* Always check out [Fun Cheap SF](https://www.funcheapsf.com) for some local and up to date things to do in the city
