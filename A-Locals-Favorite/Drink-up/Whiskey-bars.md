## Whiskey

* [Nihon Whiskey Lounge](http://dajanigroup.net/establishments/nihon-whisky-lounge/) - Mission...ish
	* It's not cheap here but they have Whiskey that you will likely not find in other places. If you are a Whiskey nerd and actually can tell the difference, definitely come here. The servers and bartenders know their stuff. 

* [Hard Water](http://hardwaterbar.com/) - Embarcadero
	* It's mainly open for lunch and after work but they have another one of the largest collections of Whiskeys I have seen. I took a buddy of mine there and he and the bartender geeked out about the process and location etc. I sat and ate. No regrets. Great food. 		
	* Depending on the day, it might be hard to get a seat

* [Whiskey Thieves](http://www.yelp.com/biz/whiskey-thieves-san-francisco) - Tenderloin
	* Whiskey dive bar 
	* Tons of whiskey but not as fancy pants as the other two above
