## Outdoor drinking

* [El Rio](http://www.elriosf.com/) - Mission..ish
	* It's nothing fancy, but they have a HUGE backyard patio and they have great parties. Great DJs, great parties, reasonably priced drinks.
	* It's more of a day bar. It's open in the evenings but the good parties are on the weekends during the day.

* [Virgil's Sea Room](http://virgilssf.com/) - Next door to El Rio
	* If El Rio is full because of a party, you'll often see people overflow over to Virgil's Next door. Smaller but larger than most back patios. Same great selection of beers and a shorter wait for the restrooms.

* [Zeitgist](http://www.zeitgeistsf.com/) - Mission 
	* Grunge dive bar with the largest beer selection on tap. Don't be surprised if the staff is not exactly attentive. There's about one bartender per 75 people there. It's mainly outdoors with a small inside bar. Serves typical bar food.
	* ProTip: Know what you want before you get to the bar. They aren't exactly patient. 
	* Cash Only (ATM insdie)		

* [Wild Side West](http://www.wildsidewest.com/) - Bernal Heights
	* Great lesbian (or used to be) bar. It's a neighborhood bar, so please respect that. Do not be loud and rowdy. It's not the type of bar where you go and try to dance on the tables or play music loud. It's a historically LGBTQ bar and has a great history. Pat & Nancy, thank you for opening this bar.
	* Great downstairs patio, cute garden. If you are curious as to the choice of decorations in the patio, look at the history, and understand. 

* [The Mix](http://www.sfmixbar.com/) - Castro
	* It's a gay bar with a nice backyard patio that is heated.

* [Toad Hall](http://www.toadhallbar.com/) - Castro 
	* Gay bar with a nice backyard patio. It's larger and more dance clubby then The Mix.
