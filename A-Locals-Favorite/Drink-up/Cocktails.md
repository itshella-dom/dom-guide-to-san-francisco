## Cocktail Bars

* [Romper Rooom](http://www.romperroom.com/) - Union Square
	* Fun little cocktail bar if you want to stay in the Union Square area. 

* [John Collins](http://johncolins.com/cocktails/) - Financial District
	* It's a cocktail bar. It's got a great bottle selection. 	

* [ABV](http://www.abvsf.com/) - Mission
	* Cocktail bar... boozy brunch... great selections	

* [The Devil's Acre](http://www.thedevilsacre.com/#home) - It says Chinatown but it's really closer to the bottom of North Beach
	* Killer Manhattans and live music

* [The European Bar & Lounge](http://www.theeuropeansf.com/) - Union Square
	* Cute quiet little hotel bar. I dig it.

* [Natoma Cabana](http://www.natomacabana.com/) - Market / SOMA
	* Cute Cabana themed bar without pushing the tropical cocktails. I heard they have a couple great Whiskey drinks like the Watchman. 			

* [Third Rail](http://thirdrailbarsf.com/) - Dogpatch
	* Great cocktails and they served pickled things and jerky.	

* [The Alchemist](http://alchemistsf.com/) - SoMa
	* Hipster mixologist drinks in a nice (but echo-y) location in Soma. Good cocktails, meh beer selection. If you want beer, you can check out the bar downstairs, the Woodbury.
