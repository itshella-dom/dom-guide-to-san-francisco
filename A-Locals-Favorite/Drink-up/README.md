# Dom's Guide to San Francisco! 

## Let's have a drink! These are some of my go-to places for a drink in the city. There's something for everyone. 

### DISCLAIMER: These are some of MY favorites. Some of the links will go to Yelp, a food rating website. I know that not everyone is a fan of elp but for ease of use, I mostly included Yelp links.

Yes, there are gay bars here and yes when you go into some of these gay clubs you will in fact see men kissing men and women kissing women. You will see people dancing half naked, some fully naked on the street. Your homophobia is NOT welcome. Someone's gender is not for you to "guess". This is a home to all but those with hate in their hearts. Do not bring your homophobic remarks or actions to San Francisco.
