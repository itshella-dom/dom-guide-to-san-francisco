## BEER

* [Black Hammer Brewing](http://blackhammerbrewing.com/) - SoMa
	* Nothing too fancy here but it's great beer. People are pretty knowledgable about their stuff here too. They have free wifi though.

* [Triple VooDoo Brewery](https://www.triplevoodoo.com/) - Dogpatch
	* Get the tasters. Just do it. There are such great things on the menu that you would be doing yourself a disservice by just picking one. Try a flight why don't ya?
	* They allow dogs :) 
	* They sometimes have events like paint night.	

* [Zeitgist](http://www.zeitgeistsf.com/) - Mission 
	* Grunge dive bar with the largest beer selection on tap. Don't be surprised if the staff is not exactly attentive. There's about one bartender per 75 people there. It's mainly outdoors with a small inside bar. Serves typical bar food.
	* ProTip: Know what you want before you get to the bar. They aren't exactly patient. 
	* Cash Only (ATM insdie)	

* [Broken Record](http://www.brokenrecordbar.com/contact/) - Excelisor
	* Another grunge dive bar. Mostly locals here. Great beer selection and whiskey on tap.
	* Serves a little better than your typical bar food. I think they were featured on the Food Network at one point.

* [The Willows](http://www.thewillowssf.com/) - SoMa
	* It's comfort bar food but they have a pretty decent selection of beers	

* [City Beer Store](http://citybeerstore.com/)	- SoMa
	* It's more like a store / bar. Not a whole lot of seating but they have a great beer selection in the fridges that you just grab and pay in the front. It's like having a bar in a BevMo except everyone doesn't hate you and they actually know things about the beers. 

* [The Beer Hall](http://www.thebeerhallsf.com/) - Civic Center
	* This is where people who know beer hang out. I am fairly certain that there are beer clubs that meet here. I have only been once but it was quiet with a great ambiance. People knew their stuff here. It's not the place you go to "grab a couple beers" before whatever, it's somewhere where you can sit and enjoy your beer. 

* [Woodbury](http://woodburysf.com/) - SoMa
	* It's a nice... very woody bar. It can get pretty loud in there and the beer selection isn't as wide as the above but it's fun. They have Super Nintendos in the back.
