## Dinner 

* [Straw](https://stawsf.com/) - Hayes Valley
  * It's a circus & carnival themed restaurant. Also has the most attentive and authentic staff. Things here have ranged from the donut burger to fried chicken and waffles to cotton candy. 
  * *Must Trys* The menu is ever changing. They do have a sake wine bowl to share. If I remember correctly, it comes with Swedish Fish swimming around in it. Oh! But get the tots. The blackberry dipping sauce is fantastic.

* [Manzoni Ristorante Italiano and Wine Bar](http://www.manzonirestaurant.com/) - Glen Park
  * If you ask people for fancier Italian recommendations, most likely they will tell you go to to North Beach district. Sure there are great places there... if you can find parking and a reservation. This is located in Glen Park, in the southern part of the city. It's fantastic, quiet and friendly Italian Restaurant.  

* [Louie's Bar](http://pourguysinc.com/) - SoMa
  * It's comfort bar food but people rave about the burgers here. Pretty good beer selection.  

* [The Taco Shop @ Underdogs](http://www.tacoshopsf.com/) - Inner Sunset
  * It's more of an American-ized Mexican food place. It's also a sports bar. They are one of the only places in the city (and Garaje) that I know of that will put fries in your burrito. I know it's not traditional, but I like what I like.   

* [Zoe's](http://www.zoessf.com/) - Mission 
  * The inside isn't impressing anyone, but who cares? They have poutine fries!
  * *Must Trys* Poutine Fries. 

* [Nostra Spaghetteria](http://www.nostrasf.com/) - North Beach
  * Build your own pasta bar, great bar. 
  * *Must Trys* Squash Ravioli, 'Nostra' Cheese Burger, Fritto Misto

* [The Pizza Hacker](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzahacker-vinyl-pop-up-san-francisco) - Bernal Heights 
  * Great thin crust real pizza. None of that Dominos crap, this is real stuff. The kind of fancy pizza with figs and arugula or simple with tomato and basil.  

* [Shabu Club](http://www.shabuclubsf.com/) - Inner Richmond
  * Japanense Hot Pot 
  * Sake, Soju, Beer
  * Fun "family style" type of place  

* [Cala Restaurant](http://www.calarestaurant.com/#menu) - Hayes Valley
  * Fancier Seafood Fusion Food
  * *Must Trys* Trout Tostada with chiptole, avocado and fried leeks, Grilled Marin Miyagi Oysters

* [Playa Azul](http://www.playazulsf.com/) - Bernal Heights 
  * Latin American food. Again, not a fancy pants type of establishment. It's not dirty by any means, but you're there for the food. The food is worth it. Lots of seafood. Mariachi bands on the weekends 
  * *Must Trys* 

* [OOLA](http://www.oola-sf.com/) -- SOMA District  
  * You may remember from the Brunch section. Truth is they have great dinner too. 

* [Cadillac Bar & Grill](http://www.cadillacbarandgrill.com/#home) - Civic Center, under Twitter.
  * It's a TexMex place. It's a little higher priced and personally I'd rather go for something in the Mission but if you want the ambiance and you're over by Twitter any way, you can go here. 
  * I really mostly included this because they have a great tequila selection  

* [Blowfish Sushi](http://www.blowfishsushi.com/) - Mission..ish
  * It's a hip fusion type sushi. Not complaining, the food and cocktails were good. 
  * *Must Trys* Pyramid of Tartare, Seared Hamachi, Bin Toro, Ritsu Roll, tons of rolls.   

* [Ace Wasabi's Rock-N-Roll Sushi](http://acewasabisf.com/) - Marina
  * Sushi meets Rock-n-roll. Interesting sushi rolls but overall a great staff and I have never been disappointed. Great music posters everywhere. It is a little loud, but that's to be expected. 
  * *Must Trys*  Over 60 types of sushi, the menu is a heavy book. -- good luck! I haven't found things I didn't like yet.

* [Skool](http://skoolsf.com/) - SoMa
  * It's seafood school themed restaurant. It's pretty good and even has a little menu if you want to bring your dog and eat on the outdoor patio  

* [Suppenkuche](http://www.suppenkuche.com/) - Hayes Valley
  * It's German food! Good German food. Good German Beers.   

* [The Progress](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-progress-san-francisco-2) - Western Addition... but like really it's by Japantown.
  * Oh, you feeling fancy? The company paying? Impress a date? Sure, come check it out at The Progress. It's more gastro-pubby with a lot of flavors for the pallet. 
  * If you can't tell, it's expensive and you will likely need a reservation.  

* [Roka Akor](http://www.rokaakor.com/) - North Beach 
  * This is probably one of my favorite date spots. It's not cheap, It's actually rather pricey but it is one of the BEST Japanese steak houses. They care about their craft here. They also have fish steamed in banana leaves, fantastic cocktails and a "Trust the Chef" menu. 
  * Yes, it is expensive and it is a little higher end but if you have the means, totally worth it. 

 * [The House](http://www.thehse.com/) - North Beach
  * Again, not the most affordable on a budget type of place but definitely more affordable than The Progress and Roka Akor. It's small, so get a reservation
  * *Must Trys* The Wasabi Noodles are fantastic. Seared Ahi and Miso Black code and Flatiron steak.    

* [Burma Superstar](http://www.burmasuperstar.com/) - Inner Richmond
  * Burmese Food
  * Okay, I get it. Everyone told you to go here, including the Food Network. The truth is, this place is actually pretty good. It does live up to it's expectations. The tea leaf salad alone is worth writing home about (by the way, it's not the only place you can get them *ahem*). But just know that you will be waiting. and waiting. and waiting. They do not take reservations, you have to get there and wait outside. On more than one occasion I will put my name down, wait, get hungry and go to somewhere else that is in walking distance. I'll be seated, I will eat, I will pay, I will leave and then I will be called by Burma Superstar and told that my table is ready. So if you go here, (especially on a Friday or Saturday night) just know you aren't the only one. The best time is really weekdays or during lunch or early dinner. Like retirement home early. 
  * Burma has little ones around the city including [B Star](http://bstarbar.com/) and [Burma Love](http://www.burmalovesf.com/). They have similar food and less of a wait.

* [Palm House](http://www.palmhousesf.com/) - Marina
  * Caribbean food. I enjoyed it. Great atmosphere and good food. They also have a shared cocktail bowl that has rubber duckies in it. 
  * *Must Trys* Jerk chicken, ceviche & plantains, 

* [El Techo de Lolinda](http://eltechosf.com/) - Mission
  * It's a rooftop tapas bar. Almost always a wait on a warm day. If you are just in it for the good food there is a restaurant below. It's a great rooftop bar though. Yes it's outdoors and yes it's covered. 
  * Great tequila and mezcal selection if you're into it.  

* [E&O](http://www.eosanfrancisco.com/) - Union Square...ish
  * Asian Fusion Seafood ish
  * Great staff, quiet date like ambiance. I'll put it this way, I went over a year ago and I just looked at the menu and it brought back all the taste memories and now I am salivating.
  * I'd get a reservation. I didn't need one when I went but it's in an area that's often packed.  

* [Foreign Cinema](http://www.foreigncinema.com/) - Mission 
  * American food
  * Indoor/outdoor patio
  * Great food and drink selection
  * More of a date night place  

* [AsiaSF](http://asiasf.com/) - SoMa
  * Every server is trans, they even have a show Transcendent.
  * Food is alright
  * Great drag during dinner
  * Must be 21+ 
  * This is where everyone goes for the bachelorette or birthday parties 
  * Don't be homophobic or rude here. This is for entertainment and fun but there is NO place for homophobia, transphobia and hate.
