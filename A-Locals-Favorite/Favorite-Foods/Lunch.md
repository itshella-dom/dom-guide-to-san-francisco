### These are in no particular order other. Lunch places are also open for dinner. Prices range from $ to $$$$. Don't worry, I put a disclaimer next to the places that would likely break the bank. 

## Lunch 

* [Ike's Place](http://ilikeikesplace.com/san-francisco) - Castro
  * My FAVORITE sandwich place in the city. I wish I could tell you it was completely overrated and that the line is not worth it and it's not that great, but it is. It really is. They also have FANTASTIC vegan and vegetarian sandwiches. 
  * Order in advance online or via their app
  * Cash only

* [Mission Rock Resort](http://www.missionrockresort.com/) - Potrero Hill
  * If weather permits, this is a great place to go. Prepare for a wait, on sunny days it's highly popular. 
  *Must Trys* I'll let you know if there is something here that *isnt* a much try, but the bloody mary is something to write home about

* [Stem Kitchen & Garden](http://www.stemkitchensf.com/) - Mission Bay 
  * American food? I never really know what that means but it was good food and great cocktail selection. The main reason I put it here is because the outside area is beautiful. If weather permits, you should check it out. Yes. It's located near the hosptial. 

* [Garaje](http://www.yelp.com/biz/garaje-san-francisco) - SoMa
  * Street Mexican Food in a converted Garage. Okay, that doesn't sound appealing but I can promise you this is good food. One of hte better vegetarian burgers in the city. And then tacos. Tostaditas. Zapatos. It's a fun little spot for lunch (open for dinner too). Beware if there is a Giants game. Place gets packed. 
  * Also have a great craft beer selection
  * Cash Only

 * [Proposition Chicken](http://www.propositionchicken.com/) - Hayes Valley
  * Chicken and Waffles. Chicken Wings.
