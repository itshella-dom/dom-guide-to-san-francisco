# Dom's Guide to San Francisco! 

## Sometimes you dont know what to eat, sometimes you want to eat EVERYTHING and sometimes you will just eat anything. This is a guide of some of my personal favorites in the city. 
### While you may know heard of some of these places, there are a some that you may not have heard of. Don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. I encourage you to have your palet explore. 

### DISCLAIMER: These are some of MY favorites. Some of the links will go to Yelp, a food rating website. I know that not everyone is a fan of elp but for ease of use, I mostly included Yelp links. 

### I am not endorsed by any of these places.

### Of course there are more places to eat. These are just some of my favorites.
