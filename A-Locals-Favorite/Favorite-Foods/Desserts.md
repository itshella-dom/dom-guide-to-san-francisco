* [Sweet Aha!](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sweet-aha-san-francisco) - Inner Sunset 
  * Feeling like a sweet tooth? This place has fantastic reviews without that hustle and bustle feel of the downtown dessert places. 

* [Creations Dessert House](http://www.yelp.com/biz/creations-dessert-house-san-francisco) -  Outer Richmond
  * Asian dessert place. It's nothing really fancy but they are only of the only places that I have found to have fresh fruit mochi. Haven't had fresh fruit mochi before? Looks like you just found an excuse to go! They also have really great tea while you wait and intereting music videos if you are into that.
  *Must Trys* Mango Mochi 

* [Mr Holmes Bakehouse](http://www.mrholmesbakehouse.com/) - Lower Nob Hill 
  * Great baked goods. They have Cruffins! So there. You can scratch your hipster bone. You've now had Croissant Muffins. 
  * Oh yeah, did I mention that there's a line? Poeple line up at around 8am for these.   

* [Hot Cookie](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-cookie-san-francisco) - Castro
  * Adult? Cookies. They come in penis and boobies and other shapes. It's in the heart of our gay district and people often go for the novelty. What they fail to rave about is how good the cookies actually are. 

* [Fraiche](http://fraiche.strikingly.com/#locations) - Fillmore
  * My partner loves this place because it serves organic frozen yogurt and it's one of the only other places in the city that makes its own mochi. 
  * They have vegan frozen yogurt too! 

* [The Ice Cream Bar](http://theicecreambarsf.com/) - Cole Valley
  * Cute 1950's themed Ice Cream Bar. They have a soda bar in the back that is incredible. 

* [Bi-Rite Creamery Ice Cream](http://biritecreamery.com/icecream) - Castro and Divis
  * Prepare to wait in a long line. Sure the ice cream is great, organic, made by hand and creamy. Sure whatever. Scratch your hipster bone and check it out. Personally I like the Ice Cream Bar and Mitchell's better.

* [Mitchell's Ice Cream](http://mitchellsicecream.com/) - Outer Mission
  * Tons of flavors. While everyone else is waiting in line for Bi-Rite, the locals will go over to Mitchell's. It's great.
