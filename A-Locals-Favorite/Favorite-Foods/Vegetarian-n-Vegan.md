### Vegetarian & Vegan

* [Shizen Vegan Sushi Bar & Izakaya](http://www.yelp.com/biz/shizen-vegan-sushi-bar-and-izakaya-san-francisco) - Mission 
  * Look it up on Google. EVERYONE raves about this place. I know I know, Vegan sushi sounds like it would be vegetables wrapped in disappointment and smothered with soy sauce but it's actually filling and fantastic. I have even taken my dad there and he had no idea what he ate was vegan. It's because rather than highlighting the vegetables, they create an experience.
  * *Must Trys* Surprise Ending, Asparagus, Budda Roll, Candlestick Roll, Hidden Agenda Roll

* [VeganBurg](http://veganburg.com/) - Lower Haight
  * I've heard amazing things of this place. Great vegan burgers with flaire that don't tell you everything you need to know about anmial cruelty. They are actually really good burgers. Light enough to get you through the afternoon if you are going for a big dinner. 

* [Eatsa](https://www.eatsa.com/) - Financial District
  * It's a fancier salad place. Honestly, I would probably only eat here if you are working in the area. It's in the Financial District so the crowd will likley be people on their lunch. I included it for those who are looking for a place to eat when they are working in the area. 
  * You order on an iPad and then go pick it up in a pod/microwave looking thing.   

* [Citizen Fox](http://www.citizenfoxsf.com/) - Mission
  * I have been looking forward to this a permanent location for a while. They were doing great as a pop-up! Looks like now they have great cocktails too! 

* [Urban Fish](http://perasf.com/urbanfish/) - Mission 
  * It's vegan and sea food. So if you are a vocal vegan, you may want to go somewhere else. If you are just a crazy picky eater who eats fish and likes vegan food then this is your spot! 
  * They have the fake meats here if you are into that. I am. 

* [Underdog: The Organic Hot Dog Joint](http://www.underdogorganic.com/) - Inner Sunset 
  * Its Vegan hotdogs.
