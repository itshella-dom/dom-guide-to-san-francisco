*TL;DR : Promo codes for SF and some local favorites*

# Welcome to San Francisco! 

Welcome to the beautiful city by the bay. I have grown up here most of my life and I would like to welcome you to my home. I created this for the friends who come and visit San Francisco and want some likely unknown information. 

### A couple thing you should know: 
* Bring a Jacket... everywhere! 
  * San Francisco is known for it's micro-climates, you can be in short sleeves and basking in the sun in the Mission district but after a quick bus ride to the Richmond or Outer Sunset, you'll be covered in fog. It's always safe to be prepared. You never know when Karl the Fog will come. 
* It's almost always between 63 degrees and 68 degrees. Year round. 
* Only tourist ride the cable car.
  * I get it, it's an iconic San Francisco thing, but did you know there are multiple places to get on the cable car that isn't Powell station? The cable car stop in the Embarcedero almost never has a wait, but if you really want the Union Square cable car experience, walk half a block up from the Powell station towards Union Square. There is another cable car stop with much less of a line. 
* We don't drive - we're driven 
  * Parking isn't impossible but it can be a hassle. Buses are unreliable and what's a taxi? Psh. A main mode of transportation here are the rideshares: Uber, Lyft, Sidecar and Homobiles. In the Promos section, you will be able to find some that will give you a full ride for free.
* Enjoy the San Francisco food
  * We have more to offer than the food you see in Union Square or Pier 39. Yes, the clam chowder bowls are amazing but if you really want to food worth salivating over head over to the Good-Eats section for some favorites and recommendations.
* There's an app for that
  * Silicon Valley's backyard has a bunch to offer. Food delivery at all hours? Sure. Someone to buy your groceries and deliver them straight to your door or Airbnb? No problem. Want to ship something out but dont want to waste your vacation in a Post Office line? We got you covered. Head on over to the Promo-Codes section to see some of what San Francisco has to offer.

*Note : This is written from the perspective of someone who has indeed grown up in San Francisco and surrounding areas. While some things may seem commercial or tourist leaning, that is because this guide is for tourists who only have a few days in our wonderful city. Also note that yes, this is not representative of how all of San Francisco operates (in reference to everyone using ride-shares and app based spoiling). This is purely a personal sharing of city information between friends.
